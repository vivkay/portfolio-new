client: Algonquin College Students Association

client-summary: Posters for All Occasions

client-about: The Students' Association at Algonquin College is a multi-million dollar independent corporation with three campuses in and around Ottawa, Canada. Involved in enhancing all aspects of student life, the SA has hosted musical headliners such as Lil Jon and The Cat Empire and Ani DiFranco, and is responsible for a broad range of student-centered entertainment, services, facilities and resources.  

goal-summary: To Create Punchy, Distinct Posters

goal: Though the Students' Association has a membership of about 16,000 students, they have an annual turnover of close to 10,000, with new students each semester. This means that information about their facilities, services, and upcoming events needs to be communicated in a fresh way throughout the year.

role-summary: Assistant Graphic Designer

role: I am lucky to have a lot of creative freedom for each project; I am responsible for conceptualizing and designing each poster, and for managing my assigned projects on basecamp. I am also the co-host of a weekly web series for the SA, with views ranging from 300 to 15,000 (but that's another story). 

challenge-summary: Keeping it Fresh

challenge: The large amount of events and services, and the ad-saturated campus environment, creates an interesting design challenge of producing punchy promotional pieces at a fast turnaround. These designs need to be engaging enough to compete with other print promotions across campus.

solution-summary: Seizing the Opportunity to Play

solution: The best way to try to keep fresh is to see each new poster project as a way to play with a new technique or idea.  

workflow-summary: Begin with The End in Mind

workflow: Because of the variety of themes, I start each poster design thinking about the personas who I want to reach (hockey fans, rock-music lovers etc.). I then consider how much copy I need to fit on a page, and define a visual hierarchy of importance. After finding inspiration for a visual direction, I'll create a proof for the head designer in our department (if it's an internal request) or for the client. After refinements and final approval, I'll upload all files to Basecamp so the team can access them in the future.

process-summary:  Illustrator and Photoshop are my Friends

process:  I use Illustrator and Photoshop for vector art, layout and photo maniuplation. I usually start by putting all required copy on the artboard so that I have a feel for how much space I have to work with. I seek inspiration online using various sites such as Pinterest, Google Images, Niiice.co and Dribbble. Once I found a theme that makes me smile or challenges me, I'll use the software to create the desired look – often using blogs or websites to help me learn new techniques as I go.  

bonus-summary: Let's Get Social!

bonus: For every poster I design, I also produce a complimentary digitally optimized graphic for social media posts. Because these are usually a square format, I need to quickly re-jig my initial tabloid layout to fit. This can be an interesting exercise in curating copy and images to create a high-impact in a small space. 

learning-summary: Typography Really is King

learning: Because of the fast turn-around of projects, I have seen immense personal growth over the span of just a few months. One thing that I am increasingly respecting, however, is the power of a good clean typographic hierarchy. Without good type, the message often falls apart. But good type can bring everything together and add real purpose and value.

outcomes-summary: Have Fun with It

outcomes: One takeaway from my time with the SA is to have fun with every project. The amazing team in marketing showed me that there's no such thing as a silly suggestion – sometimes the craziest ideas are the best ones. I love the work that the SA design team produces, and will continue to reference their designs as inspirational resources.
