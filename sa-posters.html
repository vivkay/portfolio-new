client: Algonquin College Students' Association

client-summary: Promoting student services, events and resources

client-about: The Students' Association at Algonquin College is involved in enhancing all aspects of student life and offers a broad range of student-centered entertainment, services, facilities and resources. 

goal-summary: To Create Punchy, Distinct Posters

goal: The SA has an annual turnover of close to 10,000 students per year and their primary means of communicating to new and returning students is through posters around campus. The posters must be high-impact and focused to compete with the amount of visual noise on campus.

workflow-summary: Organizing with Basecamp

workflow: The SA's marketing office includes our Marketing Manager, Marketing Assistant, Creative Services Coordinator, Outreach Coordinator, Videographer, Graphic Designer, and Graphic Design Assistant (that's me). With a high volume of new projects coming in every day, we stay coordinated internally, and with other SA departmets, using Basecamp.

challenge-summary: Keeping it Fresh

challenge: The large amount of events and services, and the ad-saturated campus environment, creates an interesting design challenge of producing punchy promotional pieces at a fast turnaround. These designs need to be engaging enough to compete with other print promotions across campus.

learning-summary: The Importance of Typography

learning: This high turn-around of projects allows me the flexibility to play and experiment with Photoshop and Illustrator. One skill I have noticeably developed is working with typography; good type can bring everything together and add real purpose and value to a design.
