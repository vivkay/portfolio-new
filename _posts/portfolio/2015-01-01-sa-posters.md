summary: The Students Association at Algonquin College is a multi-million dollar independent corporation with three campuses in and around Ottawa, Canada. The varied events and services offered creates an interesting design challenge of producing punchy promotional pieces with a fast turnaround. Almost all projects start with a few lines of copy from clients, leaving me the freedom to play with various design solutions.
