client: The Canadian Museum of History

client-summary: A User Wayfinding App

client-about: The Canadian Museum of History (CMH) is an internationally recognized cultural institution that averages over one million visitors annually. The museum is located in Gatineau, Quebec, across the water from Parliament Hill in Ottawa. Operated by the federal Canadian Museum of History Corporation, the CMH is closely affiliated with Canadian War Museum (CWM) and the Virtual Museum of Canada (VMC).  

goal-summary: An Inaugural Wayfinding App

goal: The museum wanted a digital app to compliment their existing print map, extending their wayfinding services into the mobile realm. The goal for this app was to replicate the print map but with added functionality such as information cards on key attractions within the museum.

role-summary: One Graphic Designer on a Small Team

role: I worked with a small team (a project manager, and two developers) to develop this app from low-fidelity wireframes, through to high-fidelity prototypes. For this project I worked in Illustrator and Photoshop to create client-ready mockups as well as optimized graphics for the final product.

challenge-summary: Replicating the Print Map

challenge: The main challenge for this project was the limitations of replicating the approved print map, but adjusting the view and framing for mobile devices. Finding enough space to contain the information included of a tri-fold print map was also a challenge. All text had to leave enough space for eventual translations into Chinese, French and German.

solution-summary: Reorganizing Space

solution: The final map used was a flat design replica of the print map, and we were able to organize additional information, graphics, and photography using a toggle system at the bottom of the screen. A fly-out navigation menu was also added to ease navigation and include a language toggle. 

workflow-summary: An Agile Design Process

workflow: Our team worked with an agile design process, meaning there was a fluid process of communication and integration of feedback within our team and with our clients (representatives from the department of Visitor Services and Publishing). We had internal meetings once or twice a week, and used Google Docs and Sheets to collaborate on workflow and to manage tasks and timelines.

process-summary:  Illustrator, Photoshop, InVision

process:  I used Illustrator primarily to create low-fidelity wireframes, and high-fidelity mockups. As the sole graphic designer on the project, I used vector shapes to efficiently create and manipulate button and layout variants. After some brief testing in InVision, I was able to hand off the designs to two talented developers. I then used Photoshop and Illustrator to create and export graphics and photography for the final product.  

bonus-summary: Map Icon Design

bonus: Working on the icon design for this app was one of my favourite parts of the design process. I used the golden ratio for app design from Apple and Google Material Design. The challenge was to create a mark that could adapt as new apps from the museum are released – some exhibit specific – but which would still remain unified. In the end, a simple version was selected, but I still enjoyed the process of exploring potential alternatives.

learning-summary: The Client's Perspective

learning: This project was helpful for demonstrating to me the reasons why a client might ask for specific graphics or text. For example, the final iteration of the print map campe from a professional wayfinding company, and took years to develop in collaboration with various departments across the museum. The restraints of text when considering languages that take up more space on the page (such as French and German) was also an interesting challenge.

outcomes-summary: Great Things to Come

outcomes: The department of Digital Technologies at the Canadian Museum of History is constantly evolving and expanding. I feel privileged to have been a part of this team, and look forward to seeing the exciting new interfaces that they develop.
