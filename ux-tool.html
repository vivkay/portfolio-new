client: Pointer

client-summary: A UX Research Survey App

client-about: An easy-to-use survey app inspired by the Rainbow Spreadsheet; A Collaborative Lean UX Research Tool. Pointer aims to streamline the process of collecting, crunching and sharing UX field research.  

goal-summary: To Create a Unique UX Tool

goal: Pointer was created after a conversation with a brilliant UX researcher at Shopify, during which I was introduced to the Rainbow Spreadsheet method of collecting UX field-data, developed by Google UX researcher, Tomer Sharon. With this app design, I aimed to enhance the process of using the Rainbow Spreadsheet – and to translate that experience to a mobile device so that UX researchers could be even more flexible in the field.

role-summary: Concept, Design, Presentation

role: I created this original concept and designs for an open-topic class assignment for Interactive Design at Algonquin College. I presented my ideas at the CapCHI – Computer Human Interaction in the National Capital Region – student Showcase in 2015, and the designs recieved an Honourable Mention in the 2015 RGD Student Awards.

challenge-summary: Keeping Things Simple

challenge: The main challenge for this project was trying to keep the app as simple as possible. There are so many aspects to UX research that it was tempting to try and achieve everything with this one app; instead, I decided to focus and try instead to do a couple of things really well. 

solution-summary: Quantitative and Qualitative

solution: I designed pointer to focus on a binary system of collecting feedback. This necessitates that the UX team to develop a series of questions in advance of their field-research. Additional quantitative notes can be collected using the built-in features of a microphone, camera, and keyboard that are standard on today's smart mobile devices.

workflow-summary: An Emphasis on Research and Feedback

workflow: The emphasis throughout was on creating and developing a strong and original concept. The entire process included weekly consultation with my Interaction Design Professor, Jed Looker. To kick-start this project, I created a ten page report including a summary of the anticipated User's experience, the target audience – with three sample personas – and a competitive analysis of the UX and UI trends for ten similar existing apps including SurveyMonkey, Fluid Surveys, and UX Recorder. That initial set-up lead me to the design process.

process-summary:  Paper, Illustrator, and Constant Feedback

process:  I used pen and paper for mind-mapping, visualizing the user flow, and wireframes. From there I moved into Illustrator to create wireframes. When ready, the interactive prototypes were brought into InVision to be tested by a core group of users (my classmates). After this stage, high-fidelity prototypes were designed and presented in class, and later at a student showcase.  

bonus-summary: User Testing

bonus: Using interactive prototypes in InVision, I tested the flow of using this app on classmates and friends. This provided invaluable insight on how to anticipate user-patterns. I also presented this concept and designs at a student showcase, and received valuable feedback from industry professionals.

learning-summary: There's Always Room to Improve!

learning: This project was my first in-depth application design, and in terms of interactive prototype testing. It was a wonderful introduction to appreciate the process of thinking through every click, swipe and tap that a user might make on a screen. User-testing with InVision was invaluable, and showed me that there's always something that can be improved for the best user experience!

outcomes-summary: The Start of a Big Idea

outcomes: With the feedback and encouragement I received for this project from the CapCHI Student Showcase and the RGD 2015 Student Awards Showcase, I would love to move forward and integrate the improvements into a real working prototype.
