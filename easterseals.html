project-title: Easter Seals Campaign
subtitle: Fundraising Effort

client: Easter Seals Ontario

client-summary: Helping children with physical disabilities

client-about: Explouria aims to facilitate connections between travellers and local hosts around the world. This web-based product functions similar to services such as Air BnB and Über, where travellers and tourguides use the site to create their own unique profiles and connect with each other. 

goal-summary: To create a flexible digital brand

goal: The main goal of this project was to create a visual identity that worked well on digital applications. The target audience was identified as adventure travellers aged 25-35 from a middle to upper socio-economic background. The Explouria brand needed to reach out to these users, and to communicate a sense of both reliability and adventure. 

challenge-summary: Balancing personal with digital

challenge: The main challenge for this project was combining the personal connection between the tourguide and traveller, with the digital nature of the product. As a solution, I combined a hand-scripted font for a personal feel, with the map-pin – a visual nod to digital way-finding.

workflow-summary: Open communication

workflow: The client loves pinterest, so it made sense for us to use Pinterest as a collaborative tool to get on the same page. I sketched nearly 200 variants of this logo, and provided three concepts to the client. I provided two rounds of feedback and revisions before delivering the final product. I later designed the UI wireframes for fun, as an interesting challenge.

learning-summary: The Time it Takes to be Thorough!

learning: My major learning point on this project was considering how to approach user-review and payment screens on an app. The challeng was to give the user maximum control and also help them calculate payments or input reviews efficiently.
