project-title: Explouria Branding

subtitle: Local Startup

overview: Explouria is a local Ottawa start-up by Christina Miller.

client-about: Explouria aims to facilitate connections between travellers and local hosts around the world. This web-based product functions similar to services such as Air BnB and Über, where travellers and tourguides use the site to create their own unique profiles and connect with each other across the world.   

role: I was the sole designer on this project. I worked closely with the client to understand her vision, and we used Pinterest as a collaborative tool to help us get on the same page. After researching the target audience and conducting a visual comparitive analysis of industry competitors, I provided the client with two moodboards. Once a direction was selected, I started sketching, sketching sketching! I shared three rough options with the client, and from there refined her selection, consulted for feedback, and refined again.

challenge: The main challenge for this project was finding a visual solution that appeared trustworthy and reliable, but also adventurous and fresh. 

challenge-summary: Striking the right balance

solution: The selected logo combines individual personality with references to digital way-finding. The hand-drawn letterforms communicate the uniqueness of the individual tour-guides who are represented by the company. The gometric map pin icon integrates a mark widely recognized by the online and travel community. The combination of these graphical elements show the connection between Explouria’s online platform and the personalized tours available across the world.

solution-summary: The best of both worlds
