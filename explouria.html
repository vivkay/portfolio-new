project-title: Explouria Branding
subtitle: Local Startup

client: Explouria

client-summary: An online tourist and guide matchup service

client-about: Explouria aims to facilitate connections between travellers and local hosts around the world. This web-based product functions similar to services such as Air BnB and Über, where travellers and tourguides use the site to create their own unique profiles and connect with each other. 

goal-summary: To create a flexible digital brand

goal: The main goal of this project was to create a visual identity that worked well on digital applications. The target audience was identified as adventure travellers aged 25-35 from a middle to upper socio-economic background. The Explouria brand needed to reach out to these users, and to communicate a sense of both reliability and adventure. 

role-summary: Crafting a unique identity

role: I was the sole designer on this project and worked closely with Explouria founder Christina Miller to understand her vision for the brand. We brainstormed together to define her USP (Unique Selling Point), and worked collaboratively to develop a visual identity for her startup. I provided the logo design, a full branding guide and a business card layout.

challenge-summary: Striking the right balance

challenge: The main challenge for this project was finding a visual solution that appeared trustworthy and reliable, but also fun and fresh. This company is about personal connection, wonder, and adventure but also involves online financial transactions – which demand a level of trust and reliability.

solution-summary: The best of both worlds

solution: The selected logo combines individual personality with references to digital way-finding. The hand-drawn letterforms communicate the uniqueness of the individual tour-guides who are represented by the company. The gometric map pin icon integrates a mark widely recognized by the online and travel community. The combination of these graphical elements show the connection between Explouria’s online platform and the personalized tours available across the world.

workflow-summary: Collaborative Communication

workflow: The client, Christina Miller, loves Pinterest – so it made sense for us to use Pinterest as a collaborative tool to help us get on the same page. She pinned and annotated images that she found inspirational for her vision of the Explouria Brand, and I reviewed her posts as well as added new items for feedback. Using this insight combined with my research and comparitive analysis of her competitors' brands, I provided two moodboards, each with a distinct feel. Once a direction was selected, I started sketching, sketching sketching! I shared three rough options with the client, refined her selection, consulted for feedback, and refined again.

process-summary:  Consult / Sketch / Consult / Refine / Repeat!

process: I sketched nearly 200 variants for the Explouria logo, with top five distinct favourites. I selected my top three options and sent the conceptual sketches to the client complete with individual rationales; at this stage I aimed to communicate the concept first. The next stages were more design-focused, I carefully refined the logo in Illustrator, paying close attention to alignment and balance. 

bonus-summary: Digital and Physical Applications

bonus: Though the Explouria logo is primarily for use on digital applications and websites, I love pushing designs further and exploring the flexibility of logos in various scenarios. For extra fun, I applied the brand to tote bags, stationary, and some UI layouts for web and mobile. I have a lot (I'm talking thousands) of travel photographs from my personal adventures, so it was awesome to finally use some of these images. 

learning-summary: The Time it Takes to be Thorough!

learning: My major learning point on this project was a new appreciation for the time it takes to cover key usage points in the branding guide, and to organize and exporte logo files. The final branding guide was fifteen pages including notes on application, buffer-zone, colour treatments, overlays, typography, and photography. The final files included variants optimized for print and web (svg, png, pdf, jpg), provided in black, white, and colour. I also included the full logo, the horizontal treatment, and the isolated icon. It was a lot of work, but the client was happy to have the extra flexibility and control.

outcomes-summary: A New Company is Born

outcomes: It was a wonderful treat to work with such a passionate client, and to be a part of a grassroots company born from a dream. I am excited to see Explouria grow and develop, and to watch how this brand works for the company.
