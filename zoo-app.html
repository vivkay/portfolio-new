client: Central Park Zoo

client-summary: Wayfinding App

client-about: The Central Park Zoo is part of the Wildlife Conservation Society, an organization dedicated to wildlife conservation, and which also operates the the Bronx Zoo, Central Park Zoo, Queens Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo, and New York Aquarium. 

goal-summary: A Refreshed User Experience

goal: This redesigned application aims to enhance the illustrated zoo map and add two specific user tasks – to navigate to specific animals to learn about events happening on that day. The app is designed for Android devices, and must incorporate the principles of Google's Material Design.

workflow-summary: User Testing in InVision

workflow: This project started with competitive research analysis and mapping a user flow chart with clear user objectives – to locate themselves on the map, learn more about and locate specific animals, and to navigate to events. Low-fidelity interactive prototypes were then tested on user-groups using InVision, before the final high-fidelity mockups were produced.

challenge-summary: Anticipating User Expectations

challenge: I encountered my most interesting challenge in the user-testing phase. Most users paused when looking at categories of animals when searching for a specific animal. I noticed that users were tapping even small icons of animals on the map, so I turned them into buttons instead, and re-organized the categories according to their zone/area within the zoo, rather than by their categorcial type.

learning-summary: Learning Material Design

learning: I am still new to the principles of Google Material Design, and having the requirement of applying their principles was a rewarding learning curve. There is still so much to learn, and I am glad to have exposure to this wonderful resource for UI design.
