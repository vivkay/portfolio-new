### Why I design
Awesome UI design gives me tingles and this fast-paced industry challenges me in new ways every day. There is no other job I can imagine happily jumping out of bed for every morning. 

### What I can offer
- ux/ui design internship, Canadian Museum of History
- graphic design assistant, Algonquin College Students' Association
- copy editor, DRDC Canada
- graphic design intern, Learning and Teaching Services at Algonquin College

### Going the distance
I am ready for a new adventure outside of Canada, and willing to relocate.
