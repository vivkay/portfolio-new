### awesome UI design gives me tingles

##About

I like to move it, move it! I have endless energy for graphic and interactive design.  I am driven by a deep desire to engage people, create meaningful experiences, and tell awesome stories. Basically, I want to do what all designers and coders do: make magic *cue magical hazaa sounds.*

##Process

I have learned (the hard way) that cutting corners in the early stages of a project can seriously compromise the integrity of your work. I believe in sketching, wireframes, brainstorming and an agile design process that integrates client and team feedback.
