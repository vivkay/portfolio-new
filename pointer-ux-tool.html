client: Pointer

client-summary: A UX Research Survey App

client-about: This student project received an Honourable Mention in the 2015 RGD Student Awards, and was presented at an interaction design student showcase. 

goal-summary: To Create a Unique UX Tool

goal: These designs were inspired by the Rainbow Spreadsheet; A Collaborative Lean UX Research Tool that uses Google Sheets to collect and share user feedback. Pointer aims to streamline the process of collecting, crunching and sharing UX field research.  


challenge-summary: Keeping Things Simple

challenge: The main challenge for this project was trying to keep the app as simple as possible. I designed pointer to focus on a binary system of collecting feedback. Additional quantitative notes can be collected using the built-in features of smart mobile devices.

workflow-summary: An Emphasis on Research and Feedback

workflow: I started this project with a user analysis and anticipated user-flow chart. From there I moved onto mindmapping and wireframing, consultig my interaction design professor throughout the process. I used Illustrator and InVision for my high-fidelity prototypes, sharing the designs with industry professionals for feedback, as I refined my designs.

learning-summary: There's Always Room to Improve!

learning: This project was my first in-depth application design, and a solid introduction to appreciate the process of thinking through every click, swipe and tap that a user might make on a screen. User-testing with peers using InVision was invaluable.
